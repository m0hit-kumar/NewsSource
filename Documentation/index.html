        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          NewsSource is a web-based API that provides users with trending news
          on any given topic. It collects data from various sources such as
          Google Trends, Wikipedia, Twitter, and news articles. The data is then
          summarized and analyzed for confidence using machine learning models,
          specifically Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier,
          and Logistic Regression. This documentation aims to provide a guide on
          how to use the NewsSource API to fetch data on trending topics and how
          to interpret the data.
        </p>

        <h2>Authentication and Authorization</h2>
        <p>
          This API does not require authentication or authorization for
          accessing any of the endpoints. However, if you plan on using this API
          for a production environment, it is recommended to add proper
          authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Rate Limiting</h2>
        <p>
          The API does not currently implement any rate limiting. However, if
          the API is used extensively, it may cause performance issues, and it
          is recommended to implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            - Adding support for pagination to prevent overwhelming the client
            with large amounts of data.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Adding support for sorting and filtering to allow the client to
            customize the response data.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Improving the accuracy of the machine learning model used to
            summarize and classify news articles.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Adding more sources of data for the API to fetch information from.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That concludes the documentation for the NewsSource API. If you have
